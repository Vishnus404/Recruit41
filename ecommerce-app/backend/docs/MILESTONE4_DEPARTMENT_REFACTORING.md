# Milestone 4: Department Refactoring Implementation

## Overview
This milestone refactors the database structure to move departments from embedded strings to a separate `departments` table with proper foreign key relationships.

## Database Changes

### New Department Model (`models/Department.js`)
```javascript
{
  name: String (required, unique),
  description: String,
  isActive: Boolean (default: true),
  timestamps: true
}
```

### Updated Product Model (`models/Product.js`)
- **Added**: `department_id` (ObjectId reference to Department)
- **Kept**: `department` (string, temporary for migration)
- **Added**: Virtual populate for `departmentInfo`

## API Endpoints

### New Department Endpoints

#### 1. Get All Departments
```
GET /api/departments
GET /api/departments?includeStats=true
```
**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [
    {
      "_id": "...",
      "name": "Women",
      "description": "Women department",
      "isActive": true,
      "productCount": 1500,  // if includeStats=true
      "avgPrice": 45.67      // if includeStats=true
    }
  ],
  "total": 5
}
```

#### 2. Get Products by Department
```
GET /api/departments/:id/products
GET /api/departments/:id/products?page=1&limit=10
```

#### 3. Migration Endpoint (Admin)
```
POST /api/admin/migrate-departments
```

### Updated Product Endpoints

#### 1. Products API - Enhanced
```
GET /api/products
```
- Now includes populated department information
- Supports filtering by department name (automatically converts to department_id)
- Backward compatible with existing department string filtering

#### 2. Single Product - Enhanced
```
GET /api/products/:id
```
- Now includes populated department information via `departmentInfo` virtual

## Migration Process

### Option 1: API Migration (Recommended for Production)
```bash
# Start the server
cd backend
node server.js

# In another terminal, call the migration endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/admin/migrate-departments
```

### Option 2: Script Migration
```bash
cd backend
node scripts/simpleMigration.js
```

### Option 3: Manual Migration Steps
```javascript
// 1. Extract unique departments
const departments = await Product.distinct('department');

// 2. Create department records
for (const deptName of departments) {
  await Department.create({
    name: deptName,
    description: `${deptName} department`,
    isActive: true
  });
}

// 3. Update products with department_id
for (const dept of await Department.find()) {
  await Product.updateMany(
    { department: dept.name },
    { $set: { department_id: dept._id } }
  );
}
```

## Frontend Integration

### Updated Product Service (`services/productService.js`)
```javascript
// New methods added:
productService.getDepartments(includeStats)
productService.getProductsByDepartmentId(departmentId, params)
```

### Example Usage
```javascript
// Get all departments with statistics
const departments = await productService.getDepartments(true);

// Get products in a specific department
const deptProducts = await productService.getProductsByDepartmentId(
  departmentId, 
  { page: 1, limit: 20 }
);

// Regular product fetching now includes department info
const products = await productService.getProducts();
// Each product now has departmentInfo populated
```

## Benefits of This Refactoring

1. **Referential Integrity**: Foreign key constraints ensure data consistency
2. **Performance**: Indexed relationships for faster queries
3. **Normalization**: Eliminates duplicate department strings
4. **Extensibility**: Easy to add department-specific fields (managers, descriptions, etc.)
5. **Analytics**: Better aggregation and reporting capabilities

## Migration Verification

After migration, verify with these queries:

```javascript
// Check migration status
db.products.count({ department_id: { $exists: true } })
db.products.count({ department_id: { $exists: false } })
db.departments.count()

// Test populated queries
db.products.find().populate('department_id').limit(5)
```

## Backward Compatibility

- Existing `department` string field is preserved during migration
- API endpoints support both old string filtering and new ID-based filtering
- Frontend code works without changes during transition period
- Can remove `department` string field after full migration verification

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Run migration (API or script)
2. ‚úÖ Test all endpoints with populated department data
3. ‚úÖ Update frontend components to use new department structure
4. üîÑ Monitor performance and data integrity
5. ‚è≥ Remove deprecated `department` string field (future milestone)

## Error Handling

The migration includes comprehensive error handling:
- Validates department names (non-empty, trimmed)
- Handles duplicate department creation gracefully
- Provides detailed progress logging
- Includes rollback-friendly approach (preserves original department strings)

## Performance Considerations

- Added indexes on `department_id` field
- Compound indexes for common query patterns
- Batch processing for large datasets
- Virtual population for efficient data retrieval
